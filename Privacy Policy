# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 16 Nov 2025 
**App name:** Eye Drop Reminder  
**Developer:** Ari Leshno  
**Contact:** eyephone.drops@gmail.com

---

## 1. Introduction

Eye Drop Reminder ("we", "us", "our") is designed primarily as an **offline reminder tool**. Almost all information you enter is **stored locally on your device**, not on our servers.

By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Where Your Data Is Stored

### 2.1 Data Stored on Your Device (Local Storage)

The following information is stored **only on your device** and is **not automatically sent to our servers**:

- **Reminder data**  
  Times and frequency of eye drop reminders, names/labels of drops or medications you enter, and optional notes related to reminders.

- **App settings**  
  Notification preferences, theme/UI preferences, and language settings.

This data stays on your device. If you uninstall the App or reset your device, this local data is generally deleted and **we cannot restore it** because we do not have a copy.

### 2.2 Data Stored in the Cloud (Minimal / Almost None)

By default, we **do not store your reminder content on our servers**.

Cloud-related data, if any, is limited to:

- **Crash & analytics data (if enabled)**  
  Anonymous or pseudonymous technical data (e.g., app version, device model, crash logs) used only to fix bugs and improve performance. This does **not** include your reminder texts or schedules.

- **Account / sign-in information (only if such a feature is provided and you choose to use it)**  
  A minimal identifier to recognize your account. Reminder content still remains on your device unless we explicitly offer a backup/sync feature and you enable it.

If you **do not** enable any online features (such as sign‑in or backup, if offered), we do not create a cloud profile of your reminder data.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information You Provide (Stored Locally)

Stored **locally on your device**:

- Reminder titles, descriptions, and times  
- Medication or eye drop names you manually enter  
- Optional notes or labels  
- Local settings and preferences

We do **not** ask for full medical histories or detailed health records.

### 3.2 Automatically Collected Information (Technical Data)

Stored **in the cloud only in aggregated or technical form**, if you allow analytics or crash reporting:

- Device model and operating system version  
- App version  
- Basic usage events (e.g., "reminder created", "app opened")  
- Crash logs and performance data

This information is used to understand app performance and fix issues. We do **not** link this technical data to your reminder contents.

---

## 4. How We Use Your Information

### 4.1 Local Data (On Your Device)

We use the data stored on your device to:

- Schedule and show reminders and notifications  
- Save your configurations and settings  
- Provide the core functionality of the App

This processing largely happens **on your device**, not on our servers.

### 4.2 Limited Cloud Data

We may use minimal cloud data to:

- Monitor the stability and performance of the App (analytics / crash reporting)  
- Diagnose and fix errors  
- Authenticate your account, but only if sign‑in is supported and you choose to use it

We do **not** sell your personal information, and we do **not** use your reminder contents for advertising.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share **only limited technical data** with third‑party service providers (for example, analytics, crash reporting, and cloud infrastructure providers) solely to help us operate and improve the App. These providers are not permitted to use your information for their own marketing purposes.

We **do not** share your reminder texts or schedules with advertisers. We **do not** sell your personal information.

We may also disclose information if required by law or to respond to valid legal requests.

---

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Local data (on your device)**  
  Remains until you delete it or uninstall the App. When you uninstall the App, local data is typically removed from your device. Because we do not store your reminder content in the cloud by default, we cannot recover it after deletion.

- **Cloud / technical data**  
  Retained only as long as reasonably necessary for analytics, security, and legal purposes. Where applicable, you may contact us to request deletion of identifiable data.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict certain uses of your data.

Within the App and your device settings, you can usually:

- Edit or delete reminders  
- Change notification preferences  
- Disable analytics/crash reporting where such an option is provided  
- Uninstall the App to remove local data from your device

To exercise legal rights or make a privacy-related request, contact us at **[Contact Email Address]**.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App is **not intended for children under the age of 13** (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action, such as deleting the information.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers (If Applicable)

If you use the App from outside [Your Country], your information may be processed in countries where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. Where required by law, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your information when it is transferred internationally.

---

## 10. Third‑Party Services and Links

The App may use third‑party services such as analytics, crash reporting, or cloud infrastructure. These services are governed by their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

The App may also contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.

---

## 11. No Medical Advice

The App is intended **only as a reminder tool** and does **not provide medical advice**. It does not diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease or condition. Always follow your healthcare provider’s instructions and consult a qualified professional for medical questions. Never rely solely on the App for medical decisions.

---

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top and, where appropriate, provide notice within the App or through other reasonable means.

Your continued use of the App after changes take effect will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
